"""Rewrite a sparse image so that every block is stored explicitly.

Why this exists
---------------
On this phone the bootloader treats a DONT_CARE chunk as a seek: it moves the
write pointer forward and writes nothing.  That is what makes the split flash
work at all -- each piece declares its absolute start block with a leading
DONT_CARE chunk -- but it has a consequence: the blocks a piece skips keep
whatever the partition held before.

The partition is not empty.  It still holds the previous release of the root
(the earlier SHNGROOT build), so after flashing the new image the blocks that
are DONT_CARE in the new one but carried data in the old one keep the old
bytes.  The old image differed from the new one in 310 blocks, and 47 of those
sit inside the HFS+ catalog B-tree, so the volume the kernel would mount is not
the volume the build server verified.

Making the image dense removes the question entirely: every block is stored,
so the partition ends up holding exactly the bytes of the image, whatever was
there before.  It costs 4.7 GiB of extra transfer and nothing else.

    make_dense.py INPUT.simg -o OUTPUT.simg [--verify]

The output is a normal Android sparse image in the layout this bootloader
expects (the chunk header carries the block count before the byte count, the
opposite of libsparse), so split_for_abl.py, verify_pieces.py and
simulate_flash.py all take it unchanged.

Note on chunk sizes: the byte count in a chunk header is a 32 bit field, so a
single chunk can cover at most (2**32 - 1 - 12) / 4096 = 1048575 blocks.  The
source image has chunks far larger than that, so both the input and the output
are emitted as several chunks.

The chunk size also has to stay small enough for split_for_abl.py: that tool
can only cut between chunks, so one oversized chunk produces one oversized
piece -- and a piece larger than ~2 GiB is exactly what the 32-bit fastboot
client cannot send (it dies with std::bad_alloc).  --max-chunk-mib caps the
chunk size for that reason; the default is 128 MiB.
